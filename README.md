# DH ATLAS - whitebook

# About

The whitebook is one of the main outcomes of the ATLAS project. It serves two purposes: first, to present the ATLAS catalogue and its underlying data model; second, to provide guidelines and best practices for producing "FAIR" (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) scholarly outputs in Digital Humanities and enhancing Italian digital cultural heritage.

The whitebook is aimed at future catalogue curators and scholars seeking to improve the FAIRness of their research products.

The whitebook is introduced by the review of the state of the art and the presentation of the goals and methodologies of the ATLAS project. The first chapter focuses on the evaluation of the research products used as pilots for designing the ATLAS data model, and on the guidelines for producing FAIR data. The ATLAS data model is presented in detail in the second chapter, while the catalogue with the knowledge extraction systems and web services are described in the third chapter.
