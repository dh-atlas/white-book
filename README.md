# DH ATLAS - whitebook

# About

The whitebook is one of the main outcomes of the ATLAS project. It serves two purposes: first, to present the ATLAS catalogue and its underlying data model; second, to provide guidelines and best practices for producing "FAIR" (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) scholarly outputs in Digital Humanities and enhancing Italian digital cultural heritage.

The whitebook is aimed at future catalogue curators and scholars seeking to improve the FAIRness of their research products.

The whitebook is introduced by the review of the state of the art and the presentation of the goals and methodologies of the ATLAS project. The first chapter focuses on the evaluation of the research products used as pilots for designing the ATLAS data model, and on the guidelines for producing FAIR data. The ATLAS data model is presented in detail in the second chapter, while the catalogue with the knowledge extraction systems and web services are described in the third chapter.

# Disclaimer

This initial version of the whitebook is provisional and focuses on the initial outcomes of the project: the results of the pilot evaluation, complemented by a set of guidelines for producing FAIR data (Chapter 1), and the metadata for the catalographic description of research products (Chapter 2). The refined version of the whitebook (planned for M23) will present the knowledge extraction systems, the ATLAS web application, and the web services available for browsing the catalogue (Chapter 3).
